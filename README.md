Compiled vs Interpreted:  
Programming languages help to communicate humans with computers, which speaks very different languages that's why we need a translating process and the translation can be done all at once (which is the case for the compiled langages) or can be done on the fly "step by step" (which will be the case for the interpreted languages) thus we can communicate with computers and have different paradigms to "translate" our communications.

Java programming language is a hybrid between compiled and interpreted, the whole Java infrastructure designed by Sun Microsystems, takes the best of both worlds.

```
Start
variable inputAmount = 0
variable outputAmount = 0
variable usdToBtcExchange = 0
from API get usdToBtcExchange
print "usd: " + "$"
get inputAmount
outputAmount = inputAmount * usdToBtcExchange
print inputAmount + "usd equals to: " + outputAmount + "btc"
End
```
